            <h2>who i am</h2>

            <p>
                yeah, i bet you'd like to know more about me. you and every
                law-enforcement agency on the planet (and at least one not on
                the planet...)
            </p>

            <p>
                i couldn't be who i am if i didn't know how to be nobody, so
                don't waste your time looking anywhere on the net for my
                personal details. i don't see any reason to share my profits
                with any particular government, so i'm not a citizen of
                anywhere. as far as any bureaucracy knows, i just don't exist.
                (i can make you cease to exist, for a suitable fee.) i do help
                them with their bookkeeping now and then. all those extra digits
                can be such a burden.
            </p>

            <p>
                so, what am i? i am ready to do business with you. i deal in
                anything rare, unusual, hard to find or impossible. most jobs
                are too small.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you're looking for the average cracking or fence work, look
                somewhere else. nothing about me is average, and in this world,
                you always get what you pay for.
            </p>

            <h2>what i do</h2>
